# Windows Defender Application Control Integration with Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph App Reputation Integration

In the Windows 1709 release last year, Mircrosoft introduced a new feature to the newly-renamed Windows Defender Application Control security feature in Windows: the ability to allow any applications to run that have obtained positive application reputation in Microsoft's Intelligent Security Graph cloud service, which also helps power capabilities in Windows SmartScreen, Windows Defender AV, and Windows Defender ATP.In theory, this technology could hold the potential to make adoption of application whitelisting much less painful for organizations (and individuals) by allowing commonly used Windows software from reputable publishers to run without it being necessary to have specfic rules to allow that in an whitelisting policy. This collection of sample policies, related files, and assorted notes is the result of some slightly clumsy efforts on my part to look at how well that promise translates into practice.

** Fair Warning: Do not initially deploy "enforced" versions of the sample policies here to machines that you would be really disturbed to see not boot properly, be unable to run critical applications properly, etc. Even if you deploy the audit version of the policy on a machine and nothing vital shows up in the Windows CodeIntegrity event log as being problematic. Simply put, that log does not catch everything that may render a machine unbootable. Expect that there may well be unexpected problems if you just try to take one of the enforced sample polices here, drop it in the CodeItegrity folder on your machine (with its particular configuration of hardware and drivers) hardware, and go. Test these on machines you use for TESTING things. **
